## So why Web Components?

* Polymer is a mature foundation
* DOM is your API
  * easy for non-JS devs to integrate and understand
* easy reuse of internal and external components

## and why not?

* spec in progress
  * **Shadow DOM!**
  * only newer browsers
* polyfills
* lots of **kB**?

## Possibly irrelevant and questionable

* Polymer comes with Material Design
* **There's an element for that**
